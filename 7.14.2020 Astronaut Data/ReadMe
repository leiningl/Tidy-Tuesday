Astronaut Data:

This data set included almost sixty years of astronaut data. I was curious if there was any change in the age of people we send into space over time. I was also curious if sex or military status impacted it. I noticed a few trends in the data. One was that female astronauts tend to be a few years their male counterparts. Another interesting thing I saw was despite the military providing more astronauts, civilian women were actually going to space in large numbers before women in the military. You can also see a concentration of astronauts in the 1990s.

The data this week comes from Mariya Stavnichuk and Tatsuya Corlett.

This article talks about the data set in greater detail.

This database contains publically available information about all astronauts who participated in space missions before 15 January 2020 collected from NASA, Roscosmos, and fun-made websites. The provided information includes full astronaut name, sex, date of birth, nationality, military status, a title and year of a selection program, and information about each mission completed by a particular astronaut such as a year, ascend and descend shuttle names, mission and extravehicular activity (EVAs) durations.

It may be interesting to also use the Space Launches dataset from TidyTuesday 2019, week 3.

There is also a Wikipedia Article on cumulative spacewalk records - you should be able to create the same dataset with the astronaut database and the eva_hrs_mission column.

To get that data in, use tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2019", week = 3).

# Get the Data

# Read in with tidytuesdayR package 
# Install from CRAN via: install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
# This loads the readme and all the datasets for the week of interest

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-07-14')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 29)

astronauts <- tuesdata$astronauts

# Or read in the data manually

astronauts <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-14/astronauts.csv')
