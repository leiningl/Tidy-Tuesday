I was curious to see trends by animal type and so that's what I focused on for this visualization. It seems like as a whole since about 2005 Austalia has made great progress in bringing down their euthanized pets numbers with the exeption of wildlife. I'm curious to learn why wildlife euthanasia almost tripled in the last ten years.
